This package provides an alternative word-by-word spellcheck interface.
The function `spellsuggest-and-replace' sends the word at the cursor (if
there is one) to the specified spellchecking program, and if it is
determined to be misspelled, it creates a temporary popup buffer with
alternate spellings (if they exist) as suggested by the program, with
identifiers beside each. If a key corresponding to an identifier is
pressed, the word at the cursor is replaced with the alternative
indicated. Pressing the SPACE key exits the popup buffer without
altering the text.

This code assumes some kind of `ispell -a' compatibility.

After setting either `spellsuggest-program' or `spellsuggest-args', the
function `spellsuggest-variables-update' should be called.

Example:

(require 'spellsuggest)
(setq spellsuggest-program "/usr/local/bin/hunspell")
(setq spellsuggest-args '("-i" "UTF8"))
(spellsuggest-variables-update)
